# Project Name

The project was to make a chatbot using javascript. Questions aske dby a 'bot' and receive input by user by using varying input methods (like buttons, dropdowns etc.) 

## The problem

Drew out on paper what the flow of the chatbot would be like, what kind of questions. It took a lot of time to make sense and to figure out the couple of questions/answers. Once you got the hang of calling functions and eventlisteners, it got better. 

When encountered with a problem I mostly used google, stack overflow and asked others. Explaining things to others also made it clearer for me. There were a lot of forwards and backwards with the project.
